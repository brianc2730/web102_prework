## Notes

Overall, my experience building the app went pretty smoothly. I thought the pre-work provided a really good refresher/summary on a variety of topics and the extra resources were helpful for both clarification and deeper insight into certain concepts. I also enjoyed how it was organized like a treasure hunt!
